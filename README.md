# Puplic-git
My puplic projects


## CS50
The minor programming (mprog.nl) used cs50 as a intro into programming, if you follow the course I enchourage you to first try the code on your own and after that review my code.

I learned that developing my own style and being consistent is really important to produce clear and readable code.

I recommend people with a little and without prior knowledge about programming to follow the CS50 course, very well explained.
